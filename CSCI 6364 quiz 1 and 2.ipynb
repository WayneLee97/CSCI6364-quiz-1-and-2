On IMDb, we have rate scores sollected from users and scores range from 0 to 10. There is list named IMDb top 250 where the moive with lowest score is 8.0. Now, we select 10 movies with percentage of distribution of stars they have from douban.com as the model. For example, for the new movie Tenet, 24.8% Chinese users rated 5 stars, 44.5% users rated 4 stars, 26.1% users rated 3 stars, 3.7% users rated 2 stars and the rest rated 1 star. And we label those movies with 1 or 0 which means score is over or lower than 8.0 on IMDb.
